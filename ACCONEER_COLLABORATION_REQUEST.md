# XM125 Performance Optimization Collaboration Request

**To**: Acconeer AB Technical Support / Engineering Team  
**From**: Dynamic Devices Ltd  
**Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Priority**: Technical Collaboration Request

## Summary

Dynamic Devices has developed a comprehensive XM125 radar testing framework for embedded Linux (i.MX8MM/Yocto) and identified performance optimization opportunities. We request technical collaboration to achieve optimal radar performance for room occupancy detection applications.

## Current Status

### ✅ What We Have Achieved
- **Complete Testing Framework**: Automated range, angle, and false-positive testing
- **Register-Level Control**: Full configuration and debugging capabilities  
- **Performance Baseline**: Quantified current performance vs. specifications
- **Hardware Integration**: Validated I2C implementation on ARM Cortex-A53

### ⚠️ Performance Gaps Identified
- **Range**: 6m achieved vs. 7-8m target (datasheet specification)
- **Angular Coverage**: ±30° vs. expected ±45° field of view
- **False Positives**: 1-2% rate in office environments (target <0.5%)
- **Signal Quality**: Rapid degradation beyond 5m distance

## Technical Capabilities

### Testing Framework
```bash
# Our current testing capabilities
sudo xm125-radar-monitor presence --range long --continuous --save-to results.csv
sudo xm125-radar-monitor --debug-registers presence --min-range 1.0 --max-range 8.0
```

### Data Collection
- **High-precision measurements** (millisecond timestamping)
- **Signal quality analysis** (STRONG/MEDIUM/WEAK/NONE classification)
- **Environmental sensitivity** testing (HVAC, lighting, interference)
- **Long-duration stability** testing (24+ hours)

### Hardware Validation
- **I2C Communication**: 400kHz, validated timing and signal integrity
- **GPIO Control**: Reset, boot mode, wake control verified
- **Register Access**: Complete presence detector register map (0x0040-0x0080)
- **Power Supply**: Clean 3.3V with proper decoupling

## Specific Technical Questions

### 1. Register Configuration Optimization
**Current Settings**:
```
Intra Threshold: 1300    Inter Threshold: 1000
Frame Rate: 12Hz         Sweeps Per Frame: 16
Range: 0.5m - 7.0m      Detection: Fast + Slow motion
```

**Question**: Are these optimal for room occupancy detection? What values would you recommend for maximum range and minimum false positives?

### 2. Performance Comparison
**Observation**: Windows evaluation tool appears to achieve better range and angular coverage with identical hardware.

**Question**: Are there configuration differences or advanced registers not documented in standard presence detector documentation?

### 3. Environmental Optimization  
**Target Environment**: Office spaces (3m x 4m to 10m x 15m) with LED lighting, HVAC, and electronic equipment.

**Question**: What register configurations or calibration procedures are recommended for this environment type?

## What We Can Provide
