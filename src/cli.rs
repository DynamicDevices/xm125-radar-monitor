    long_about = "XM125 Radar Module Monitor v2.0.0

Production-ready CLI tool for Acconeer XM125 radar modules with automatic firmware 
management and streamlined commands for technicians.

QUICK START:
  1. Check device status:        xm125-radar-monitor status
  2. Distance measurement:       xm125-radar-monitor distance
  3. Presence detection:         xm125-radar-monitor presence
  4. Continuous monitoring:      xm125-radar-monitor presence --continuous --count 100
  5. Firmware management:        xm125-radar-monitor firmware check

DISTANCE MEASUREMENT:
  # Single distance reading
  xm125-radar-monitor distance

  # Continuous distance monitoring with CSV export
  xm125-radar-monitor distance --continuous --count 100 --interval 500 --save-to distance.csv

  # Custom range configuration
  xm125-radar-monitor distance --range 0.1:3.0

PRESENCE DETECTION:
  # Single presence detection (default long range: 0.5m - 7.0m)
  xm125-radar-monitor presence

  # Custom range with high sensitivity
  xm125-radar-monitor presence --min-range 0.3 --max-range 5.0 --sensitivity 2.0

  # Continuous monitoring with register debugging
  xm125-radar-monitor --debug-registers presence --range long --continuous --count 100 --interval 500

  # Room occupancy monitoring with CSV logging
  xm125-radar-monitor presence --range long --continuous --save-to occupancy.csv

FIRMWARE & HARDWARE:
  # Check device status and firmware
  xm125-radar-monitor status
  xm125-radar-monitor info

  # Firmware management
  xm125-radar-monitor firmware check
  xm125-radar-monitor firmware update presence
  xm125-radar-monitor firmware bootloader

  # GPIO control
  xm125-radar-monitor gpio init
  xm125-radar-monitor gpio status

DEBUGGING & TROUBLESHOOTING:
  # Register debugging (works with any measurement command)
  xm125-radar-monitor --debug-registers presence --range medium

  # Verbose I2C logging
  xm125-radar-monitor --verbose distance

  # JSON output for automation
  xm125-radar-monitor --format json presence --continuous --count 10

All measurement commands automatically handle connection, firmware detection, and calibration.
Use --verbose for detailed I2C transaction logs and --debug-registers to compare with evaluation tools.
